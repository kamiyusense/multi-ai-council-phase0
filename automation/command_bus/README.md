# Chat/Work GitHub command bus

GitHub is the durable control plane. Commands and receipts are append-only; only loop state is mutable.
The processor validates the repository, the target PR, `expected_target_head` (the current head of `expected_pr`), correlation, expiry, STOP, terminal receipts, and the six-round ceiling before processing.
The carrier/implementation PR head is separate metadata and is never compared through `expected_target_head`.
Unknown or ambiguous conditions are blocked without retry or fallback.

Reviewer work is represented by append-only `review_request`, `review_claim`,
and `review_response` records. A reviewer is identified only by its instance,
generation, role, and capability; no Chat or thread ID is part of correctness.
Only one non-expired claim is active, stale generations and duplicate
responses are rejected, and Work consumes a response only after exact
loop/round/correlation/target-head validation. Missing, empty, or unverifiable
responses are `UNKNOWN` and fail closed.

The runtime is intentionally limited to `automation/command_bus/**`; it does not execute Jules, providers, live models, API keys, or GitHub workflows.
